Right from the beggining i want to make one small excercise. 
I want all of us to briefly introduce ourselves
Let's start from me. 
So My name is Roman. Currently working as Go Software Engineer at Softserve 
I've been coding in Go for almost 4 years. Also worked before with Java, C, and sometimes using
a bit of Python and Typescript.

My expectation is to give you basic go knowledge for you to be able read go code 
easily and to be . 

And now that's you're turn

Simplicity & Readability
Go code is very easy to read, you will see and feel it later during this course.
Very low magic and syntax sugar.
Go fmt built in tool

Compiled & Statically typed language
static typing and run-time efficiency (like C)
All your dependencies are built into your binary

Powerful Standard Library
Powerful Concurrency
Garbage collector

Golang is a multi-paradigm programming language. 
Golang is not a functional language but has a lot of features that enable us to 
applies functional principles in the development, turning our code more elegant, 
concise, maintainable, easier to understand and test.
It's also Object oriented language. But with some

What projects should you use Go for?
Go will definitely do the trick if youâ€™re planning to develop the underlying services for your app. More than that, Go is good for scalable high-performance apps. Below, we list some apps and services that are enjoying the benefits of Go to the max.

Cloud services
As the creator of Go, Google is using this language to provide cloud infrastructure: it offers top performance and scalability to the Google Cloud Platform. But there are even more well-known cloud businesses out there using Go for the same reasons: Dropbox, Terraform, Kubernetes, and Docker.

Media platforms  
YouTube, SoundCloud, and Netflix chose Go to fight with high loads on their sites. SoundCloud uses this language for deploying some internal services within their complex projects.

News outlets
Back in 2012, the BBC (yep, it was a surprise to us too) started using 
Go for backend development and some of the elements of their internal analytics services.

On-demand services
The taxi giant Uber was looking to improve map processing speeds as people loaded geofence lookups, sending literally thousands of queries per second. Go helped Uber significantly reduce the timing of providing services to users, which was much appreciated by users.
