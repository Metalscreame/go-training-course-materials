/*
When an interface has zero methods, it is called
an empty interface. This is represented by interface{}.
Since the empty interface has zero methods, all types implement this interface implicitly.
Have you wondered how does the Println function from the fmt built-in package accepts the different types of value as arguments?
This is possible because of an empty interface. Letâ€™s see the signature of Println function
