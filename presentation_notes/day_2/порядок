dependency injection
accept interfaces, return structs
Interfaces allow us to create the
function that only depends upon what we need.
go has no way to abstract out struct members values.
So, if your function needs to access struct members
(and not just functions on the struct),
then youâ€™re forced to accept the struct directly.
