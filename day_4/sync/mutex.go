/*
sync.RWMutex
sync.RWMutex is a reader/writer mutex.
It provides the same methods that we have just seen with Lock()
and Unlock() (as both structures implement sync.Locker interface ).
Yet, it also allows concurrent reads using RLock() and RUnlock() methods:

A sync.RWMutex allows either at least one reader or exactly one writer whereas
a sync.Mutex allows exactly one reader or writer.
